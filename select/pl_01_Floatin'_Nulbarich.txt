Staring at the night view
I couldn't picture
a better moment than this
yeah even if I tried to
Even if I close my eyes
I can picture all the nights
underneath this nice view
Must be the California air
First time I had to stop&stare
It's like I don't even know
even know how I got here
I'm weightless
I don't even feel the ground
Something in the water
when Iʼm in this town
I'm lost in the city
hope Iʼm never found
Cloud 9 yeah my head is
in the clouds
Guess I finally know
what they talking' bout
It got me so high
never coming down
I should be homesick
at this altitude
Close to the stars yeah
Have I gone too far yeah
Oh no no
I ain't coming down
from the atmosphere
Got me upside down like
I'm in amirror
Feels like I'm levitating yeah
It feels like I'm floatin'
It feels like I'm floatin'
On top of the world yeah
I'm on the edge
I don't wanna leave
I ain't ready yet
Feels like I'm levitating yeah
It feels like I'm floatin'
It feels like I'm floatin'
Cruising down to Venice beach
So many sites
that Iʼm tryna see
On top of the downtown
skyscrapers
So surreal you would think
it's all made up
I don't wanna wake up
from the city of dreams
Between
this place&home yeah
I'm stuck in between
Never felt this way
Never felt this feeling
Oh no no
I ain't coming down
from the atmosphere
Got me upside down like
I'm in amirror
Feels like I'm levitating yeah
It feels like I'm floatin'
It feels like I'm floatin'
On top of the world yeah
I'm on the edge
I don't wanna leave
I ain't ready yet
Feels like I'm levitating yeah
It feels like I'm floatin'
It feels like I'm floatin'
I should be homesick
at this altitude
A dance on the moon yeah
I ain't going back yet
Oh no no
I ain't coming down
from the atmosphere
Got me upside down like
I'm in amirror
Feels like I'm levitating yeah
It feels like I'm floatin'
It feels like I'm floatin'
On top of the world yeah
I'm on the edge
I don't wanna leave
I ain't ready yet
Feels like I'm levitating yeah
It feels like I'm floatin'
It feels like I'm floatin'
